# Pascal-Bitmap-Tool

still working on this though nearing final stages of debuging.
goal was to write a bitmap tool using procedural programming and then
convert it to an object oriented pattern designed program.

after final debug a mitigate functiion will be added to each concrete product 
for handling errors and a few more controls like kernel height and size or quantization to colour sets.
